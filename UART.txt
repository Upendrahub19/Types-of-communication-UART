COMMUNICAION PROTOCOLS:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*INTRO
~~~~~~~
Data transmission types:-

1)Simplex:- 
	->one device transmits and other device receive
	->communiation is possible in one direction only
          eg:radio
          TX------------>RX
2)Half-duplex:-
	->two devices can send and receive from each others
	->two way communication but only one way at a time
	eg: walkie-talkie
	  TX<----------->RX
3)Full-duplex:-
	->communication is possible in both directions,both sides can transmit and receive at the same time 
	->eg:phone cell
             ------------------->
           TX                     RX

TYPES OF COMMUNICATION:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


UART:-
~~~~~
->UART stands for Universal asyncchronous Transmitter and Receiver
->It was designed by GORDEN BELL for lond distance communication.
->It is a two wired communication protocol
  Txd and Rxd
->It is a full duplex asynchronous serial communcation protocol.
   & also it can be used synchronous serial communicatio protocol by connecting externnal clock 
->The max speed is 1 Mbps(40 mts).
->It is designed for long distance communication
->Data transfer from LSB->MSB.
->No acknowledgement present inside the UART
->Size of data frame 10 bits[start bit, stop bits and 8 data bits)
->Designed for peer to peer communication[means one to one]
->Ex:- Apllications of UART[Bluetooth headset and mobile phone]
